# Coding Style (TypeScript/React)

- Prefer explicit function signatures; avoid `any`
- Use meaningful names; early returns for control flow
- Keep components small and pure; use hooks correctly
- No inline comments; write comments above complex blocks and explain what each function does and their use case
- Match existing formatting; avoid unrelated reformatting
- Never have more than one component in a file unless absolutely necessary
- Keep the code absolutely clean, maintainable and understandable
