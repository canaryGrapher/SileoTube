# Project Structure

- Entry HTML: [index.html](mdc:index.html)
- App entry: [src/main.tsx](mdc:src/main.tsx) mounts React and imports [src/index.css](mdc:src/index.css)
- Background service worker: [src/background.ts](mdc:src/background.ts)
- Vite config: [vite.config.ts](mdc:vite.config.ts) builds background as `background.js` and emits `reload.txt` in dev
- Manifest: [public/manifest.json](mdc:public/manifest.json) is copied to `dist` by Vite `publicDir`
- Components: [src/components/*] has all the compnents that are needed for the application
- Utilities: [src/utilities/*] has further folders like [/functions] and [/hooks] to store the hooks and functions that are used in the main component. 

# Build Outputs
- `dist/index.html` (popup) and `dist/background.js` (service worker)
- Static assets from `public/` are copied as-is into `dist/`
