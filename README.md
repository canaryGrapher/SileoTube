# SileoTube – Focused, Distraction-Free YouTube Experience

SileoTube is a distraction-blocking extension designed to help you stay focused while using YouTube — so you’re not bombarded with endless recommendations, autoplay videos, or comment noise.
SileoTube lets you choose what stays and what disappears.

It works quietly in the background, automatically applying minimal, clean layouts across YouTube pages such as the homepage, watch page, and search results — making YouTube feel peaceful again.

🎯 Reclaim Your Focus

YouTube is an incredible tool for learning and inspiration — but it’s also filled with distractions engineered to keep you scrolling.
SileoTube helps you reclaim your attention by letting you:
	•	Watch content without getting pulled into the next recommendation
	•	Search and learn without unrelated suggestions
	•	Keep your focus on what truly matters — the video or topic at hand

No logins, no trackers, no data collection. Just simplicity and focus.
